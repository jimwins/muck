* create databases from scat/ordure dump files on initial creation

* search should wait until db is available for indexing

* put sphinx wordforms in an ordure table and automatically regenerate it on
  reindexing

* generate certs with openssl locally if we don't have lexicon configuration

* make scat and ordure available at ${MUCK_HOST}/scat and /ordure, too
